        Not much is known about Rick's life before his current state seen in the show except for a few things that have been vaguely
        mentioned in the series. It has been mentioned multiple times that Rick has been absent from the family for at least
        fourteen years and it wasn't until one year before the events of "Something Ricked This Way Comes" when Rick finally
        returned to the Smith house on January 15th.[4] The reason for his absence is unknown to the rest of the family.
        In the Pilot episode, Rick told Beth that he loved the eggs that she made him and that her mother would have loved
        them too if she were still there. In the episode Rick Potion #9, it is revealed that Rick has a very pessimistic
        worldview, informing Morty that love is "just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed", advising him not
        to continue the cycle of love, marriage and heartbreak that he had to go through and that his parents would likely
        go through, encouraging him to direct his energy towards science. This could imply that the woman he married before
        is either divorced and/or deceased as of now. In the same episode, he and Morty leave their original dimension (Dimension
        C-137) in favour of the one they currently reside in. In the episode Get Schwifty, it was revealed that when Rick
        was somewhere in his college years or in his 20's, he, Birdperson, and Squanchy were in a rock band called "The Flesh
        Curtains". Rick is 60 years old and currently resides in his room in the Smith house. In the garage, he works on
        his inventions and scientific formulas and tests them out, traveling to other dimensions, building various robots
        and devices, and causing general mayhem in different parts of the universe In the episode "The Wedding Squanchers",
        Rick willingly turned himself over to the Galactic Federation and was sent to one of their maximum security prisons.
        He currently resides there, with little chance of bail, parole or escape.
